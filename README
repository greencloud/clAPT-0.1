About
-----

clapt is a command-line utility that basically combines some APT options such
as 'update', 'upgrade', 'autoclean' and 'autoremove' with ClamAV utililties 
such as 'freshclam' and 'clamscan'. When updating/upgrading and cleaning my
own computer, I usually end up typing a lot of commands at the terminal. This
utility basically combines all of these commands in one.
